## Plugin Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. Check if a similar plugin already exists
2. Ensure your plugin follows the structure below
3. Test locally before submitting
4. Write clear documentation

### Plugin Structure

All plugins follow this structure:

```
plugins/your-plugin-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude-plugin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin.json          # Required: Plugin metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ rules/                   # Optional: Symlinks to .cursor/rules/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/                # Optional: Symlinks to .claude/commands/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                  # Optional: Symlinks to .claude/agents/
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Required: Plugin documentation
```

### Creating a New Plugin

#### 1. Create Plugin Structure

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/your-plugin-name/{.claude-plugin,rules,commands,agents}
```

#### 2. Create plugin.json

`plugins/your-plugin-name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "description": "Brief description of what this plugin provides",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"
  },
  "tags": ["relevant", "tags", "here"]
}
```

#### 3. Add Canonical Content

**For rules** - Add to `.cursor/rules/`:
```bash
# Create your rule file
touch .cursor/rules/your-category/your-rule.mdc

# Symlink from plugin
ln -s ../../../.cursor/rules/your-category/your-rule.mdc plugins/your-plugin-name/rules/
```

**For agents** - Add to `.claude/agents/`:
```bash
# Create your agent file
touch .claude/agents/your-agent.md

# Symlink from plugin
ln -s ../../../.claude/agents/your-agent.md plugins/your-plugin-name/agents/
```

**For commands** - Add to `.claude/commands/`:
```bash
# Create your command file
touch .claude/commands/your-command.md

# Symlink from plugin
ln -s ../../../.claude/commands/your-command.md plugins/your-plugin-name/commands/
```

#### 4. Create README.md

`plugins/your-plugin-name/README.md`:

```markdown
# Your Plugin Name

Brief description of what this plugin provides.

## Installation

\`\`\`bash
/plugin install your-plugin-name
\`\`\`

## What's Included

Describe what types of content this plugin provides (rules for X framework, agents for Y task, commands for Z workflow) without listing every file.

## Usage Examples

Show how someone would actually use this plugin in their workflow with concrete examples.

## Compatibility

- Cursor: âœ“

## Related Plugins

- `related-plugin-1` - Why it's related
- `related-plugin-2` - Why it's related
```

#### 5. Update Marketplace Manifest

Add your plugin to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "your-plugin-name",
      "source": "./plugins/your-plugin-name",
      "description": "Brief description",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating a Personality Plugin

Personalities have a special structure:

```
plugins/personalities/personality-yourname/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude-plugin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin.json
â”œâ”€â”€ cursor/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ yourname.mdc         # Cursor format (with alwaysApply: true)
â”œâ”€â”€ claude/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ yourname.md          # Plain markdown (no frontmatter)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

**Cursor version** (`cursor/yourname.mdc`):
```markdown
---
description: Brief personality description
alwaysApply: true
---

# Your Personality Name

[Personality characteristics and patterns]
```

**Claude version** (`claude/yourname.md`):
```markdown
# Your Personality Name

[Same content as Cursor version, but no frontmatter]
```

## Quality Standards
