# Project Context File Research & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The AI coding tools ecosystem has evolved from fragmented tool-specific configurations (`.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) toward a unified standard: **AGENTS.md**. This research examines the current landscape, best practices, and provides recommendations for implementing a single source of truth for project context across multiple AI coding assistants.

**Key Finding**: AGENTS.md has emerged as the vendor-neutral standard, supported by OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Sourcegraph Amp, and increasingly by other tools. It's currently used in 20k+ open source projects.

---

## The Landscape: Tool-Specific vs Universal Standards

### Historical Context

Different AI coding tools developed proprietary context file formats:

| Tool | Primary File | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | Active, but migrating to AGENTS.md |
| **Cursor** | `.cursorrules` → `.cursor/rules/` | Deprecated → Modern |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Active + AGENTS.md support |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` | Active |
| **Sourcegraph Amp** | `AGENTS.md` | Native support |
| **Continue** | `.continuerules` | Active |
| **JetBrains (Junie)** | `.junie/guidelines.md` | Active |

### The Convergence: AGENTS.md

In July 2025, OpenAI introduced AGENTS.md as an open standard:

> "AGENTS.md — a simple, open format for guiding coding agents"

**Why it matters:**
- **Cross-tool compatibility**: One file works across Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others
- **Team consistency**: Contributors can use different tools but share the same context
- **Future-proof**: Vendor-neutral standard reduces lock-in
- **Widespread adoption**: 160k+ GitHub repositories already using related formats

### Migration Strategy

The recommended approach for existing tool-specific files:

```bash
# Create AGENTS.md as the primary source
mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md

# Create symlinks for backward compatibility
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md
```

This ensures existing tool integrations continue working while transitioning to the universal standard.

## What Goes in a Project Context File?

### Core Philosophy

A project context file serves as **onboarding documentation for your AI teammate**. Unlike README (which targets human developers), it contains:

- **Detailed technical context** that AI needs to make correct decisions
- **Specific commands and conventions** to avoid hallucination
- **Project-specific constraints** and preferences
- **Iterative refinements** based on actual AI behavior

### Essential Sections

Based on Anthropic's recommendations and community best practices:

#### 1. **Tech Stack & Dependencies**

Be specific about versions to prevent version mismatches:

```markdown
## Tech Stack

- Node.js 20.x
- TypeScript 5.3
- React 18.2 with Next.js 14
- MUI v3 (important: not v4 or v5)
- Emotion for styling
- MobX for state management
```

**Why**: AI models may default to more common versions or patterns if not specified. Explicit versions prevent hours of debugging incompatible code.

#### 2. **Project Structure**

Help the AI navigate your codebase efficiently:

```markdown
## Project Structure

- `src/components/` - React components, organized by feature
- `src/lib/` - Shared utility functions
- `src/styles/` - Design tokens in `DynamicStyles.tsx`
- `scripts/` - Build and deployment automation
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration and commands
```

**Why**: Reduces token waste from the AI exploring the wrong directories. Speeds up task completion.

#### 3. **Commands**

Critical for preventing the AI from guessing or using wrong commands:

```markdown
## Common Commands

**Development**:
- `pnpm dev` - Start dev server (use pnpm, not npm)
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript compiler check only

**Build**:
- `pnpm build` - Production build
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build locally

**Per-file testing** (faster than full builds):
- `pnpm test:file <path>` - Test single file
```

**Why**: Avoids expensive mistakes like running `npm install` in a `pnpm` project, or attempting full rebuilds when testing a single file.

#### 4. **Code Style & Conventions**

Be opinionated and specific:

```markdown
## Code Style

**DO**:
- Use Emotion `css={{}}` prop format for styling
- Import design tokens from `DynamicStyles.tsx` - never hardcode colors, spacing, or breakpoints
- Use MobX stores for state management, not useState for shared state
- Follow conventional commits format for commit messages
- Write tests for all new features

**DON'T**:
- Don't use inline styles with hardcoded values
- Don't create new CSS files (use Emotion)
- Don't install new dependencies without discussion
- Don't modify files in `/generated` directory
```

**Why**: This section typically has the highest ROI. Real example: Without specifying MUI version and Emotion format, AI generated v4 code with different APIs, requiring complete rewrites.

#### 5. **Testing Instructions**

Clear guidance on test requirements and execution:

```markdown
## Testing

- All new features require tests
- Tests live in `__tests__/` directories next to source files
- Run full suite: `pnpm test`
- Run specific test: `pnpm test:file src/components/Button/__tests__/Button.test.tsx`
- CI runs on all PRs - must pass before merge
- Minimum coverage: 80%
```

**Why**: Establishes quality expectations and prevents the "write code but skip tests" pattern.

#### 6. **Repository Etiquette**

How to work with version control:

```markdown
## Repository Guidelines

**Commits**:
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Reference issues: `feat: add dark mode toggle (#123)`

**Branches**:
- Main branch: `main` (protected)
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`

**PRs**:
- All changes require PR review
- Include tests and documentation
- Ensure CI passes
```

**Why**: Maintains git history quality and prevents merge conflicts from poor branching strategies.

#### 7. **Warnings & Gotchas**

Document unexpected behaviors or sharp edges:

```markdown
## Important Warnings

- Build process requires 4GB RAM minimum
- The `/legacy` directory uses old patterns - don't replicate its style
- WebSocket connections timeout after 5 minutes - implement reconnection logic
- Dark mode tokens are separate from light mode - test both themes
```

**Why**: Saves hours of debugging mysterious failures that are already known issues.

### Optional Advanced Sections

For larger or more complex projects:

#### 8. **Architecture & Design Patterns**

```markdown
## Architecture

- Use composition over inheritance
- Follow React Hooks patterns (no class components)
- API calls go through `src/lib/api/` client
- Error boundaries at route level
```

#### 9. **Development Environment**

```markdown
## Environment Setup

- Requires `.env.local` with: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`
- Optional: `.env.local.example` shows required variables
- Use Docker for local database: `docker-compose up -d`
```

#### 10. **Performance Considerations**

```markdown
## Performance

- Images must use Next.js `<Image>` component
- Lazy load components below fold
- API routes should respond in <200ms
- Use React.memo for expensive list renders
```

---

## What NOT to Include

Equally important is knowing what to exclude:

### ❌ Avoid Long Prose

**Bad**:
> "Our project uses a modern, cutting-edge approach to state management that leverages the power of MobX, a battle-tested library that has been proven in production environments..."

**Good**:
> "Use MobX for state management"

**Why**: Every character consumes tokens. AI needs facts, not marketing copy.

### ❌ Avoid Duplicating README

**Don't repeat**:
- Project description
- Installation instructions for end users
- License information
- Contributing guidelines (unless AI-specific)

**Why**: README already covers this for humans. Context files should focus on AI-specific needs.

### ❌ Avoid Vague Guidance

**Bad**:
> "Write good code and follow best practices"

**Good**:
> "All functions must have JSDoc comments. Use TypeScript strict mode."

**Why**: Vague guidance doesn't change AI behavior. Specific rules do.

### ❌ Avoid Overly Restrictive Rules

**Bad**:
> "Never use any dependencies. Never create new files. Never refactor."

**Why**: This hamstrings the AI's ability to help. Be opinionated about conventions, not paralyzed.

---

## File Locations & Hierarchy

### Repository Root (Recommended)

**File**: `AGENTS.md` at project root

**Benefits**:
- Discoverable by all tools
- Committed to git for team sharing
- Single source of truth
- Works with monorepos using nested files

**Example**:
```
my-project/
├── AGENTS.md           # Main project context
├── CLAUDE.md           # Symlink → AGENTS.md
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/          # Cursor-specific rules (if needed)
└── packages/
    ├── frontend/
    │   └── AGENTS.md   # Frontend-specific context
    └── backend/
        └── AGENTS.md   # Backend-specific context
```

### Home Directory (Global)

**File**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.config/agents/AGENTS.md`

**Use case**:
- Personal preferences (e.g., "always use pnpm")
- Cross-project conventions
- Tool-specific settings

**Should NOT contain**:
- Project-specific information
- Team conventions (these belong in repo)

### Local Overrides

**File**: `AGENTS.local.md` or `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored)

**Use case**:
- Personal workflow preferences
- Local development shortcuts
- Experimental rules

**Example .gitignore**:
```
*.local.md
AGENTS.local.md
CLAUDE.local.md
```

---

## Iterative Refinement Strategy

### Start Small

Don't try to write the perfect context file upfront. Start with:

1. **Tech stack** (frameworks, versions)
2. **Key commands** (dev, build, test)
3. **3-5 most important conventions**

### Observe & Refine

Track patterns in AI behavior:

- **When AI makes mistakes**: Add a rule to prevent it
- **When you repeat instructions**: Add them to the file
- **When code quality improves**: Keep the rule

### Use Real Feedback Loops

Many tools support dynamic updates:

- **Claude Code**: Use `#` keyboard shortcut to add current instruction to context file
- **Cursor**: Project rules can be edited and take effect immediately
- **Manual**: Keep a scratch file of "rules to add" during sessions

### Test Changes

After updates:

1. Start fresh conversation/session
2. Give AI a representative task
3. Evaluate if behavior improved
4. Iterate

### Version Control Best Practices

```bash
# Commit context file changes with descriptive messages
git add AGENTS.md
git commit -m "docs: add MobX state management requirement to AGENTS.md"

# Review changes in PRs
# Treat AGENTS.md changes like code - they affect output quality
```

---

## Tool-Specific Considerations

### Claude Code

**Native support**: `CLAUDE.md` files at multiple levels

**Locations checked** (in order):
1. Current directory and parents
2. Project root
3. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global)

**Best practice**: Create `AGENTS.md` and symlink `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md`

**Directory structure**:
```
.claude/
├── context.md              # Base context (optional, legacy)
├── commands/              # Slash commands
│   ├── commit.md
│   └── review.md
└── agents/                # Sub-agents (if using agent framework)
    └── reviewer.md
```

### Cursor

**Modern approach**: `.cursor/rules/` directory

**Benefits**:
- Multiple rule files
- Path-based scoping
- Version controlled

**Migration**:
```bash
# Old way
.cursorrules

# New way
.cursor/
└── rules/
    ├── typescript.md      # TypeScript-specific rules
    ├── react.md          # React-specific rules
    └── testing.md        # Testing rules
```

**Also supports**: Reading `AGENTS.md` automatically

### GitHub Copilot

**Primary**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Also supports**: `AGENTS.md` (as of August 2025)

**Recommendation**: Use `AGENTS.md` and optionally symlink Copilot file

### Sourcegraph Amp

**Native support**: `AGENTS.md`

**Also reads**: `AGENT.md` (backward compatibility)

---

## Size & Token Considerations

### The Token Tax

Every character in your context file consumes tokens on **every** AI interaction:

- **Small file** (1KB): ~250 tokens per request
- **Medium file** (4KB): ~1000 tokens per request
- **Large file** (10KB): ~2500 tokens per request

Over a 100-message session:
- Small: 25k tokens (affordable)
- Large: 250k tokens (expensive, may hit limits)

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Be concise**: Bullet points, not paragraphs
2. **Use code blocks**: Clear examples, minimal explanation
3. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't repeat information
4. **Split by scope**: Use nested files in subdirectories for subsystem-specific rules
5. **Link, don't duplicate**: Reference other docs when appropriate

### When to Split

Consider multiple context files when:

- **Monorepo**: Different packages have different conventions
- **Polyglot project**: Backend and frontend use different stacks
- **Large codebase**: >100k LOC with distinct subsystems

**Example hierarchy**:
```
AGENTS.md                    # Shared conventions (1KB)
frontend/AGENTS.md           # React-specific (2KB)
backend/AGENTS.md            # Node.js-specific (2KB)
mobile/AGENTS.md             # React Native-specific (2KB)
```

Total per context: 3KB instead of 7KB monolithic file.

## Recommendations for This Project (ai-coding-config)

### Current State Analysis

This project currently has:
- `.claude/context.md` - Contains identity and rule loading instruction
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands
- Multiple personality directories with `claude/` subdirectories
- Extensive plugin architecture

### Recommended Structure

```
AGENTS.md                    # New: Universal project context
CLAUDE.md                    # Symlink → AGENTS.md
.claude/
├── context.md              # Keep for identity/personality (or merge into AGENTS.md)
├── commands/              # Keep as-is
└── agents/                # Keep as-is
```

   - Test personality changes before committing
   - Respect plugin boundaries

---

## Migration & Command Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Initial AGENTS.md

Command should:
1. Analyze project to understand tech stack
2. Generate initial AGENTS.md with core sections
3. Create symlinks for tool compatibility
4. Prompt user to review and customize

### Phase 2: Update Mechanism

Command should:
1. Detect if AGENTS.md exists
2. Analyze recent commits/changes to understand updates needed
3. Suggest additions based on:
   - New dependencies
   - New conventions observed in code
   - Repeated AI mistakes (if trackable)
4. Show diff and ask for approval before updating

### Implementation Considerations

**Avoid**:
- Overwriting user customizations
- Generating generic boilerplate
- Creating overly long files

**Include**:
- Project-specific intelligence (scan package.json, tech stack)
- Interactive prompts for ambiguous choices
- Diff preview before changes
- Backup mechanism

---

## Key Insights from Research

### 1. **The Virtuous Cycle**

> "When we set up a good context file, the agent's performance gets better. As it gets better, we tend to use it more, which helps us further improve and refine the context."

Investment in context files compounds over time.

### 2. **Specificity Over Generality**

Projects with specific, actionable rules see dramatically better AI output than those with vague guidance.

### 3. **The README Question**

Some argue: "If you need to tell AI this, your README is incomplete."

**Counter-argument**: Context files serve a different purpose:
- README: Human onboarding, project description
- AGENTS.md: AI-specific conventions, commands, gotchas

Both can coexist and complement each other.

### 4. **Tool Consolidation Trend**

The ecosystem is moving toward AGENTS.md as the standard. Early adoption positions projects well for future tool compatibility.

### 5. **Don't Over-Engineer Early**

Start small. Real project usage reveals what rules matter. Premature optimization wastes time on rules that don't affect behavior.

---

## Final Recommendation

### The File: AGENTS.md

**Primary recommendation**: Use `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth.

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ Vendor-neutral standard
2. ✅ Growing ecosystem support (20k+ projects)
3. ✅ Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others
4. ✅ Future-proof naming
5. ✅ Clear semantic meaning

### Compatibility Layer

**Create symlinks** for tool-specific names:

```bash
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s AGENTS.md .cursorrules  # If needed for legacy support
```

### This Project's Approach

For `ai-coding-config` specifically:

1. **Create** `AGENTS.md` with project-specific context
2. **Symlink** `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md`
3. **Keep** `.claude/context.md` for identity/personality (or merge)
4. **Keep** `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/agents/` structure
5. **Document** the convention in this project's docs

### Command Design

Create `/init-agents` command that:
- Generates intelligent AGENTS.md by analyzing project
- Creates compatibility symlinks
- Prompts for customization decisions
- Supports update/refresh mode

---

## Open Questions for Design Decisions

Before implementing the command, clarify:

1. **Identity & Personality**: Should personality instructions live in AGENTS.md or remain in `.claude/context.md`?

2. **Scope**: Should the command:
   - Generate generic templates, or
   - Intelligently analyze the codebase and create project-specific content?

3. **Update Strategy**: When AGENTS.md exists, should updates:
   - Be fully manual (user edits directly)?
   - Be AI-assisted (command suggests additions)?
   - Be automated (command syncs with detected changes)?

4. **Multi-tool Strategy**: Should we generate tool-specific files or just use symlinks?

5. **Monorepo Handling**: For projects with plugins, should we create:
   - One AGENTS.md at root?
   - Nested AGENTS.md per plugin?
   - Both with inheritance?

6. **Content Philosophy**: Prioritize:
   - Comprehensive documentation (larger file), or
   - Minimal essential context (smaller file, lower token cost)?
