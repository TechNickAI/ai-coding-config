## What They Do

Open-source prompt collection for multiple AI coding assistants. Focus on project
scaffolding and coding standards. Part of the larger Instructa AI tooling ecosystem.

## Why They Matter

Multi-tool support without locking to one assistant. Well-organized prompt library with
good categorization. Practical focus on scaffolding and standards.

## What We Can Learn

Prompt organization: Category structure. Naming conventions. Directory layout.

Multi-tool handling: Tool-specific format differences. Common patterns across tools.
Translation approaches between formats.

Content types: Popular prompts. Scaffolding patterns. Coding standards templates.

## Key Files to Review

Directory structure for prompt organization. Tool-specific formatting approaches.
README for documentation style.

## Our Differentiation

Plugin system instead of just files. Agents and skills beyond prompts. Philosophy layer
with values. Bootstrap automation instead of manual setup.

They're lighter-weight but less comprehensive than our approach.
