## What They Do

Community-curated .cursorrules files for Cursor AI. Ready-to-use configurations
organized by category. Simple model with no tooling - just copy files.

## Why They Matter

Massive community traction makes this the clear space leader. Hundreds of battle-tested
rules covering Angular, React, Vue, Python, Go, Rust, and more. The content itself is
a goldmine for understanding what users want from AI coding configurations.

## What We Can Learn

Content patterns: How they organize rules by language, framework, use case. What
patterns appear across high-quality .cursorrules files.

Community model: PR-based contributions. How they maintain quality. How they became the
go-to resource for Cursor users.

## Limitations (Our Opportunity)

Static files only with no plugin system. Cursor-specific so it doesn't work with Claude
Code. No versioning or update mechanism. Manual copy-paste installation.

## Key Files to Review

README.md for organization and presentation. The rules/ directory for actual content.
Contributing guidelines for community engagement model.

## Our Differentiation

Plugin-based distribution instead of copy-paste. Cross-tool support for both Cursor and
Claude Code. Commands, agents, and skills beyond just rules. Heart-centered philosophy
layer.
