# Ruff Linting

We use `ruff` for linting. If there are lint errors, or if the user says "fix lint errors":

1. Run: `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes`
2. Repeat until all errors are fixed

## Using Targeted Ignores

For legitimate exceptions, use targeted ignores with specific rule codes and explanations:

```python
# Include the rule code and why you're ignoring it
process = subprocess.Popen(["pbcopy"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # noqa: S603 S607 - Needed for clipboard access

result = eval(user_formula)  # noqa: S307 - Safe: formula validated by parser

api_key = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")  # noqa: S105 - Environment variable, not hardcoded secret
```

Use `# ruff: ignore=RULE_CODE` for the new format or `# noqa: RULE_CODE` for compatibility with other linters.

When you fix all errors, celebrate! ðŸŒŸ
