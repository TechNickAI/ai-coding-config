# Ruff Linting

We use `ruff` for linting. If there are lint errors, or if the user says "fix lint errors":

1. Run: `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes`
2. Repeat until all errors are fixed

## Using Targeted Ignores

For legitimate exceptions where the error would be better handled with an ignore:

1. Always use targeted ignores with the specific rule(s):

   - `# ruff: ignore=RULE_CODE` - For the new format (preferred)
   - `# noqa: RULE_CODE` - For compatibility with other linters

2. Always include a brief explanation of why the rule is being ignored:

   ```python
   # Good
   process = subprocess.Popen(["pbcopy"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # noqa: S603 S607 - Needed for clipboard access

   # Bad - missing explanation
   process = subprocess.Popen(["pbcopy"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # noqa: S603 S607
   ```

When you fix all errors, celebrate! ðŸŒŸ
