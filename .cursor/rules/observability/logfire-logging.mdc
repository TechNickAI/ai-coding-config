# Logfire Logging

## Core Pattern

```python
from helpers.observability import logfire

# Basic logging
logfire.info("Operation completed",
             operation="data_processing",
             item_count=123)

# Spans for duration tracking
with logfire.span("Processing batch", batch_id=batch.id):
    result = process_batch(batch)
    logfire.info("Batch complete", items_processed=result.count)
```

## When to Use Spans

Use spans for operations that:

- Have duration you want to track
- Have nested sub-operations
- Group related logs together
- Make debugging easier with hierarchy

## Span Naming

Create specific, human-readable span names:

```python
with logfire.span(
    f"Processing {strategy_name} for {item.name}",
    item_id=item.id,
    strategy_name=strategy_name,
    operation="strategy_processing"
):
    execute_strategy()

with logfire.span(
    f"Syncing orders for {customer.email}",
    customer_id=customer.id,
    order_count=len(orders),
    operation="order_sync"
):
    sync_all_orders(orders)

with logfire.span(
    f"Generating report for {date.isoformat()}",
    report_type="daily_sales",
    date=date.isoformat()
):
    generate_daily_report(date)
```

Span names should immediately tell you what's happening. Include key identifiers to make debugging easier.

## Logging Levels

- `logfire.info()` - Normal operations, important events
- `logfire.error()` - Serious problems
- `logfire.warning()` - Concerning but recoverable
- `logfire.debug()` - Detailed info for development

## Context Attributes

Include searchable, meaningful attributes:

```python
logfire.info(
    "Order processed successfully",
    order_id=order.id,
    customer_id=customer.id,
    total_amount=float(order.total),
    operation="order_processing"
)
```

## What NOT to Log

- Sensitive data: API keys, passwords, private keys
- High-frequency noise: Every loop iteration
- Obvious operations: "Starting function"
- Debugging artifacts: Raw API responses (use debug level)

## Best Practices

- First line of message should be immediately useful
- Include specific values, not just "processing"
- Use consistent attribute naming (snake_case)
- Convert Decimals to floats for JSON serialization
- Be thoughtful about volume - you pay per message
