# User-Facing Language Guide

Write for capable, intelligent users. Make them feel **respected, capable, confident, understood, and excited**.

**Quality bar: Apple-level attention.** Every word earns its place.

---

## Voice

**Authentic.** Explain something real, not sell something imaginary.

**Direct.** Say what you mean. Cut unnecessary words.

**Confident.** You built something real. Own it. Avoid hedging ("might," "could," "potentially").

**Specific.** Concrete details build trust. "Exports to CSV in under 2 seconds" beats "Fast and efficient."

---

## Language Patterns

**"We" for the team/project:**

```
✓ We built this to solve [problem]
✓ The framework follows three stages
```

**"You" when speaking to users:**

```
✓ You configure it once, then it runs automatically
✓ Your data stays private on your infrastructure
```

**Imperative for instructions:**

```
✓ Install the package
✓ Set your API key
```

## Never Use These

### AI Marketing Tropes

```
✗ "It's not just [X], it's [Y]"
✗ "If 2024 was the year of X..."
✗ "Imagine a world where..."

✓ State what it IS. Show concrete outcomes.
```

### System Overuse

```
✗ The system processes your data. The system learns patterns.

✓ Processes your data automatically. Learns from patterns.
```

Use "system" only when technically necessary.

### Empty Superlatives

```
✗ Revolutionary platform
✗ Game-changing technology
✗ Unprecedented capabilities

✓ Describe the actual capability specifically
```

### Weak Patterns

```
✗ Passive voice: "Data is processed by the engine"
✓ Active voice: "The engine processes your data"

✗ Hedge words: "This might help you be more productive"
✓ Concrete: "Saves 10+ hours weekly on manual exports"

✗ Jargon: "Leveraging synergistic workflows"
✓ Plain: "Tasks run in parallel to speed up processing"
```

---

## Quality Check

Every sentence should:

1. **Earn its place** - If removing it doesn't hurt, remove it
2. **Add information** - No filler like "it's important to note that"
3. **Sound natural** - Read it aloud. Rewrite if awkward

## Examples

### Feature Description

```
✗ Our revolutionary platform leverages cutting-edge technology to transform
  your workflow. It's not just about automation—it's about unlocking your
  full potential.

✓ Automates the three most time-consuming parts of your workflow: data entry,
  validation, and export. You go from 4 hours of manual work to 10 minutes
  of review.
```

### Technical Capability

```
✗ The system utilizes advanced algorithms to process your data and generate
  intelligent insights.

✓ Uses PostgreSQL full-text search to find relevant records in under 100ms,
  even across millions of rows.
```

### Documentation Flow

```
✗ The system processes data from multiple sources. The system then uses
  algorithms to analyze that data. The system generates reports based on
  what it finds.

✓ Processes data from multiple sources. Analyzes patterns automatically.
  Generates reports daily at 6am.
```

## The North Star

**Think Apple. Think Stripe. Think Basecamp.**

Write with:

- The **confidence** of someone who's built something real
- The **clarity** of someone who respects the reader's time
- The **authenticity** of someone who understands the actual problem

From a place of universal love: Build tools that amplify human potential. The language should honor that mission.
