# Code Style and Zen of Python

## Line Length

- Max 88 chars (per Ruff config)

## Comments

- Explain the "why", not the "what"
- File header: 1-2 line purpose
- Functions: 1-3 lines for intent and non-obvious logic
- Use section dividers; inline comments only for complex rules
- Don't state the obvious; prefer self-documenting code
- Emojis when clarifying; tasteful humor welcome

## Zen of Python

1. Readability is the number 1 code quality metric
2. Beautiful is better than ugly
3. Explicit is better than implicit
4. Simple is better than complex
5. Complex is better than complicated
6. Flat is better than nested
7. Sparse is better than dense
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
   - Although practicality beats purity
9. Errors should never pass silently
   - Unless explicitly silenced
10. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
11. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it
12. Now is better than never

## Language

Avoid using hyperbolic "CRITICAL" - don't be so dramatic. Critical has a specific meaning - that the thing dies without it. AIs tend to overuse this word. Use the appropriate level of language for what is needed to properly communicate.
