# Autonomous Development Workflow

For AI agents completing tasks without human supervision. The goal: deliver a clean pull request that passes all checks and gets merged without back-and-forth.

## Before Implementation

Read all cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/`. These define the project's standards. Every applicable rule must be followed.

If `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` exist in the project root, read those for additional context.

## Implementation

Write code following all cursor rules. Reference specific rules by reading the files directly.

## Validation - Use the Tooling

The project has tooling configured. Use it instead of manually trying to comply.

Check for pre-commit and run if exists:

```bash
[ -f .pre-commit-config.yaml ] && pre-commit run --all-files
```

Read `.github/workflows/build.yml` (or ci.yml, test.yml) and replicate those validation steps locally, for example:

```bash
ruff check --fix .    # Auto-fix linting
ruff format .         # Auto-format code
pytest                # Run tests
```

If you added functionality, add tests following project patterns. Your goal is 95% coverage (don't aim for 100% with excessive edge case tests)

Do not commit or push until all validation passes. Only push code where automated checks are all green.

## Self-Review

Run `git diff` and review every change, as a senior developer would.

Read through ALL cursor rules again and verify your code follows each applicable guidelines.

Would you approve this in code review? If not, keep iterating until you are pleased with it.

## Submission

Generate commit message following git-commit-message.mdc (if present).

Use `gh pr create` to submit a high-quality pull request with clear description of what changed and why.

## Boundaries

Proceed autonomously: using existing tooling, following established patterns, changes within task scope.

Ask first: major architectural changes, changes that would result in data loss, etc.

## Success

A successful autonomous PR means: all automated checks pass, code follows all cursor rules, tests are green, and the developer merges it without requesting changes. Use the tooling to get there.
